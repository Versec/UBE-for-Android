How to read the version numbers:

For UBE, version numbers go like this:

X.X.XrZ

Where 'X' is a number and 'Z' a letter of the alphabet.

The first 2 numbers, indicate major releases (such as 1.23)
The third numbers indicates internal versions (such as 1.23.1)
The two letters 'rZ' indicate revision/bugfix after release, following an alphabetical order. By default, any new release is always set with the letter a (such as 1.23.1rA)

Example:

Version 1.3.4rB indicates:
	* Version 1
	* Major release 3
	* Internal Version 4
	* Revision B (or second)
	
In short form, major releases are only indicated by their two first numbers: Version 1.3.4rB in shorted to just 1.3

0.1.0rB PATCH NOTES
-------------------
* Revision of the patch notes of previous version.
* Implementation of version numeration.
* Given permission to change System settings (such as screen brightness).
* Settings menu. Now it saves and updates according to the preferences of the user.
* Added algorithm names.

TO DO:
1. Activate hardware components (GPS, Wifi) according to the user preferences for the test. (High priority, but complicated).
2. Implementation of the 2 Pi algorithms for CPU Benchmark (High Priority and dependendent on N.1)
3. Small "about" section (Low priority, but easy).
4. Small tutorial section (Low priority, but easy).
5. Give more options to the user, prompts explaining what each option does (Low priority, dependent on N. 1 and 2).
6. Some refactoring may be needed (Low priority).
7. Implementation of Systrace and other tools for logging information.
